# Neovim Config


Here is my neovim configuration powered by [Litlua](https://github.com/jwtly10/litlua)!


All my plugins are documented as `litlua.md` files [here](https://github.com/jwtly10/config.nvim/tree/main/lua/jwtly10/lazy)


*How does neovim use these files???*

You can run the command:

```bash
litlua .
```

In the config root, and all the files will be compiled to `.litlua.lua` which
neovim will automatically source on startup!


You can also install the litlua-lsp and files will automatically be compiled on save!


You can see the demo of this working in realtime here: https://github.com/jwtly10/litlua?tab=readme-ov-file#demo
